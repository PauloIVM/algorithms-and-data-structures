Approachs useds:
    - Incremental approach (insertion-sort)
    - Divide-and-conquer approach:
        Break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original prob-
        lem but smaller in size, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine these
        solutions to create a solution to the original problem.
